**Speed Up Internet** (also called **SPI**) is a **Batch/PowerShell** script that **"fights for the User."**
This script **optimizes your connection** by lots of **verified methods.**

## NOTE
I'm currently needing **your help**. If you got any suggestion about the script, like the tweaks or the script code itself, **issue** or **make a pull request.**

**THIS SCRIPT WILL NOT REVERSE CHANGES. Use the script at your OWN RISKS.**

## Getting Started

* To use **SPI**, download the **self-extracting .exe** file given, run it and it will **extract SPI.cmd and the tools\ folder** to the current directory.
* Copy **both of them** to the desired directory of the target machine.

## Prerequisites

* Services related to Internet connection **must be turned on.**

## Usage
One-press optimization. Open by **the given shortcut** for it to work.

## Built with

* [Notepad++] (https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) - The source code editor.
* [PowerCmd] (https://www.powercmd.com/) - The command prompt replacement.

## Acknowledgments

* This script is not contain any malicious codes/viruses.
* All the modules were commented for you to see what SPI does.
* To improve the optimize speed, this script will use multi-task technique, meaning that there will be
several instances running all at once.
* Debugging is always harder than programming, so if you write code as cleverly as you know how, by
definition you will be unable to debug it.
